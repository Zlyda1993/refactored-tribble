# Portfolio

## I designed this website to showcase a portolio of my current work that i have achieved with the knowledge i have learned thus far.

## I hope to use this as a stepping stone to get better as creating an online portfolio to help promote myself to potential employers in the future as well as show off my work to anyone that were to ask me of my current endeavors.

## I was able to gain more insight on how to move and position elements such as images and text on a webpage using syntax sych as text-align and i also gained knowledge of how to place a gradient as the background for my website.

## A special thanks to Jacob Nordan during my tutoring sessions for helping me figure out some of my positioning issues and how to correct them.
